1. Image downloading and caching
2. The notifications need to be worked on and perfected


look at image_grid_tile and dynamic_image_preview


I can send single images with no breeze, the data gets uploaded to firebase and the cloud function works perfectly.However
on the UI layer it attempting to download the images immediately, which means it's still using the down-dated url and this
results to some unintended errors (Icons)

2 images, the url does not get updated. But there's an indication that it's being updated

3 images, I see no updates to the data in firebase, but it gets sent

4 images, client-side error
