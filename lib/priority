1. Saving images locally, so the app does not have to download it everytime
2. Start with noti





I can send single images with no breeze, the data gets uploaded to firebase and the cloud function works perfectly.However
on the UI layer it attempting to download the images immediately, which means it's still using the down-dated url and this
results to some unintended errors (Icons)

2 images, the url does not get updated. But there's an indication that it's being updated

3 images, I see no updates to the data in firebase, but it gets sent

4 images, client-side error
